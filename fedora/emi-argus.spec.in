%description 
Argus EMI meta-package (PAP, PDP and PEP Server).
The Argus Authorization Service is composed of three main 
components:
- The Policy Administration Point (PAP) provides the tools to 
author authorization policies, organize them in the local 
repository and configure policy distribution among remote PAPs.
- The Policy Decision Point (PDP) implements the authorization 
engine, and is responsible for the evaluation of the authorization
requests against the XACML policies retrieved from the PAP.
- The Policy Enforcement Point Server (PEP Server) ensures the 
integrity and consistency of the authorization requests received 
from the PEP clients. Lightweight PEP client libraries are also 
provided to ease the integration and interoperability with other 
EMI services or components.
