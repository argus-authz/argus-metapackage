Description: Argus metapackage.
 The Argus Authorization Service is composed of three main 
 components:
 - The Policy Administration Point (PAP) provides the tools to 
 author authorization policies, organize them in the local 
 repository and configure policy distribution among remote PAPs.
 - The Policy Decision Point (PDP) implements the authorization 
 engine, and is responsible for the evaluation of the authorization
 requests against the XACML policies retrieved from the PAP.
 - The Policy Enforcement Point Server (PEP Server) ensures the 
 integrity and consistency of the authorization requests received 
 from the PEP clients. Lightweight PEP client libraries are also 
 provided to ease the integration and interoperability with other 
 EMI services or components.
